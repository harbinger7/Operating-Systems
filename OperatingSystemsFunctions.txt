One of the functions of an operating system is memory management. When a program is executed it has to go through the main memory first. It also keeps track of where memory is stored and what memory has or hasn't been used. Another thing memory management does is cease using memory when an action has been stopped or continue using an action that can continue.

Another operating system function is device management. This is needed to control all the devices connected to a computer system. The device management operating system function would be responsible for devices like keyboard, mouse, and the printer. It also controls any new additions like a USB drive connecting to a part on the computer.

Another operating systerm function is process management. This operating system fuction is responsible for the processing time for the different processes on a computer. A process management function uses the central processing unit in order to fulfill its jobs. It also decides the order processes are completed by prioritizing the most important or recent process.
